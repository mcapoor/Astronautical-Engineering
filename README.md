# Astronautical-Engineering
The programs I create to simplify the work needed for the orbital calculations, mechanics, and structural analysis of Astronautical Engineering

## Usage:
The only currently working aspect is the Hohmann transfer protocol. Call `main.py` in the Hohmann Transfer directory.

## Future Plans:
Solve the Gauss and Kepler programs to calculate Rendezvous
Implement fuel mass calculations with the Tsiolkovsky equation for a given fuel type and engine
